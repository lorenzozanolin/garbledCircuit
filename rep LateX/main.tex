\section{Introduction}
The aim of this project is the study of Yao's protocol \cite{yao} and an useful application of it. More precisely, we will implement Secure multi-party computation; this field has the goal of creating methods for parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private \cite{mpc}. In this project, the function we decided to implement is the \textit{8 bit sum}.
