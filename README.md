# Garbled Circuit
Project for the Introduction to Cybersecurity course. The aim is to develop an Yao's Protocol implementation[^fn3]; we will use it to sum two sets of values.  

Alice and Bob have two sets of numbers (given by the user), they compute the sum of this set on their own. Then they execute the secure sum of their
set's sum using Yao's protocol.
Since we are using 8 bit to represent the sum of each set, it immediatly follows that the sum of each set must be smaller than 256. In this case we are dealing with integers, thus we also need to consider negative numbers; to do that we are using 2- complement. In this case we are considering numbers that belong to [-128,127]. The final sum has 9 bit representation, thus the result that we can obtain belongs to [-256,254].

The circuit is represented in the above figure.

| <b>Circuit </b>|

It is made of two components: Half adder, full adder and a If-Then-Else.

Half adder is used to sum the right-most digit of the number.

Full adder is used to sum a generic digit in the number, ranging from position 1 to 8. It receives in input also carry of the previous sum.

If Then Else is used to prevent overflow, induced by the 2-complement sum.

## Project structure

The structure of the src folder is the following:

-   `MAKEFILE`: contains the commands to be executed.

-   `circuit/add.json`: contains the circuit of the 8-bit sum.

-   `sets/alice.txt`: Alice's input. User insert the input via terminal, then program saves it in this file

-   `sets/bob.txt`: Bob's input.  User insert the input via terminal, then program saves it in this file

-   `code/yao.py`: contains the library[^fn1].

-   `code/main.py`: contains the main logic of the script.

-   `code/util.py`: contains some useful functions used in main.

-   `code/requirements.py`: contains functions requested by the project.

-   `code/ot.py`: contains functions used to implement OT.

## Usage

You need to run the program using two different actors, say Alice and Bob. First, open two separate shells windows and execute `src/Makefile`.

```
cd src/  
make parties

NOTE: parties can be "alice" or "bob"
```

Now, for each party, you must enter the set of integers involved in the sum. Cardinality of the sets is unbounded; keep in mind that the sum of each set must belong to [-128,127].
